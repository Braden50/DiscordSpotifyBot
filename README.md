Huge shoutout to Hizkia Felix and his discord bot repo (https://github.com/hizkifw/bop)
I had made the discord bot from scratch initially, but one of my dependencies, youtube_dl, became unusable and I defaulted to a fork yt_dlp.
When looking for usages of this forked package, I came upon Hizkia's repo and quickly discovered that he structured his code extremely well... much better than what I quickly threw together. Due to this, I copied a good portion of his repo for my bot's skeleton.
